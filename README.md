# Stream processing with Spark and Kafka
This Spark-based code is conducted at the S-Fog tier of the two-tier fog layer in our proposed multi-layer stream and big data analytics platform in order to perform real-time stream processing on a large number of park-slot records streamed from multiple gateways at the edge layer.
